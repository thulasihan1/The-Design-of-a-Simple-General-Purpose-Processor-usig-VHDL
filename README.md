# The-Design-of-a-Simple-General-Purpose-Processor-usig-VHDL

Designed and constructed an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) in VHDL environment and implemented it on an FPGA board.  
Designed  all functions of the ALU. 
Designed, simulated and programmed the ALU using VHDL on an Altera FPGA board (Based on Functional Simulation in Quartus Simulator). 
Downloaded the program on the FPGA board and displayedthe desired outputs on LEDs and 7-segment displays.
